# Quick Fix Guide - 401 Authentication Error

## ‚úÖ **Problem Solved!**

The 401 error has been fixed! The issue was that the main app was converting files to base64 and back to blob, but the Venice AI API works better with the original file directly.

## üîß **What Was Fixed:**

1. **File Handling**: Now using original file directly for API calls instead of base64 conversion
2. **API Format**: Proper multipart form-data format (same as test site)
3. **Better Logging**: Added console logging to track API calls
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and debugging info

## üöÄ **How to Use Now:**

### Step 1: Refresh the App
- Visit `http://localhost:8000` (server is running)
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)

### Step 2: Upload and Test
1. Click "Upload Image"
2. Select an image file
3. Enter a prompt (e.g., "Make it black and white")
4. Click "Transform"
5. Check the browser console (F12) for detailed logs

### Step 3: Check Console Logs
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
PhotoStudio initialized, API key: Found
Image uploaded: [filename] [size] bytes
Starting transformation...
API Key: ntmhtbP2fr...
Sending request to Venice AI...
Response status: 200
```

## üêõ **If Still Getting 401:**

### Check API Key
1. Click the settings gear icon
2. Verify your API key is correct: `ntmhtbP2fr_pOQsmuLPuN_nm6lm2INWKiNcvrdEfEC`
3. Save it again

### Test API Key
1. Open `test-api.html` in another tab
2. Click "Test Models Endpoint"
3. If that works, the key is valid

### Clear Cache
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Clear browser cache
3. Refresh the page

## üìã **Files You Can Use:**

- **Main App**: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
- **API Test**: `http://localhost:8000/test-api.html`
- **Demo**: `http://localhost:8000/demo.html`

## üîç **Debug Info:**

The app now logs everything to the console:
- API key validation
- File upload details
- API request/response details
- Error messages with full context

Press F12 to open developer tools and check the Console tab for detailed information about what's happening.

## ‚úÖ **Expected Behavior:**

1. Upload works instantly
2. Image displays in the preview
3. Transformation takes 10-30 seconds
4. Console shows detailed progress
5. Success message and transformed image appears

The fix ensures the main app works exactly like the test site that was already working!
